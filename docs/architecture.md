# Architecture Notes

Internal reference for agents and maintainers. Read this before changing cross-module data flow, service boundaries, API routing, or long-lived architecture. For user-facing docs, use `documentation/docs/`.

## Module Map

- `cmd/qui/main.go`: CLI entrypoint for serve, config generation, user creation, and other commands.
- `internal/api/`: HTTP handlers, middleware, and routing.
- `internal/qbittorrent/`: qBittorrent client pool and sync manager.
- `internal/services/`: domain services such as cross-seed, Jackett/Torznab, reannounce, and tracker rules.
- `internal/proxy/`: reverse proxy support for external apps.
- `internal/backups/`: scheduled snapshots.
- `internal/database/`: SQLite/Postgres migrations and database setup.
- `internal/models/`: data models and store interfaces.
- `pkg/`: shared utilities.
- `web/src/`: React 19, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind frontend.

## Core Data Flow

1. `SyncManager` polls qBittorrent instances through `ClientPool`.
2. Torrent state is cached in memory with delta updates.
3. Frontend reads state through REST APIs and receives live updates through SSE.
4. Cross-seed services react to torrent completion and search/match events.

## Frontend Live State Note

`web/src/components/torrents/TorrentDetailsPanel.tsx` live row state such as speed, progress, ratio, and state is stream-backed via `useSyncStream`. Polling only runs as a fallback while the stream is unavailable. Content/files and Peers tabs still poll on an interval, but polling is tab-scoped and visibility-gated, so streaming them is optional future work rather than a pending migration.
