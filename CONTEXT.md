# qui

qui manages torrent-client state and workflows for a self-hosted installation.

## Language

- **External Program**: A user-configured executable that qui may invoke with data about one torrent. _Avoid_: Hook, script.
- **Execution Request**: A request to run an External Program for one torrent. _Avoid_: Job, task.
- **Admitted Execution**: An Execution Request accepted for future execution. It does not mean the program started. _Avoid_: Successful execution, started execution.
- **Running Execution**: An Admitted Execution whose External Program has started and has not exited. _Avoid_: Queued execution.

## Cross-seed search

- **Usable result**: A search hit that survives release and size filtering. Retry passes gate on usable results, never on raw hit counts. _Avoid_: Hit, raw result (when gating is meant).
- **Mixed mode**: One search fan-out where ID-capable indexers receive an ID-only query and the rest receive the title query. Lives in the jackett layer; callers opt in with the `OmitQueryForIDs` flag on an ID-carrying movie or TV request. _Avoid_: Hybrid search, dual query.
- **Arr IDs**: External IDs (imdb/tvdb/tmdb/tvmaze) supplied by a Sonarr/Radarr lookup or its cache. The highest-trust ID source.
- **Tag-sourced IDs**: External IDs read from the Matroska tags of the source file. Trusted blind for querying; a wrong tag is caught by result filtering, not by pre-validation. _Avoid_: MediaInfo IDs (ambiguous with the library name), embedded IDs.
- **Per-indexer retry**: A retry pass that re-queries only the indexers holding no usable result, leaving satisfied indexers untouched. Cross-seed success is per tracker, so one indexer's match never blocks another's retry. The yearless retry is a whole-search retry, not a per-indexer one. _Avoid_: Fallback search, retry-all, rescue pass.
- **Title rescue**: A matching rule, not a search pass. A candidate whose title differs from the source is still accepted when the reported total size is exactly equal and every other release attribute matches. Off by default; Skip recheck disables it. _Avoid_: Rescue pass, fuzzy match.
- **Query degradation**: A per-search flag telling the frontend the search ran at lower precision than intended (title-only when IDs were wanted). An ID-quality primary, arr- or tag-sourced, is not degraded.
- **Manual match**: A cross-seed apply where the user chooses the target torrent. Candidate discovery and the category and content-type gates are bypassed; the recheck is the arbiter of a wrong pick. _Avoid_: forced match, pinned match.
