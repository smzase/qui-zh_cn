# Hardlink Mode

Hardlink mode is an opt-in cross-seeding strategy that creates a hardlinked copy of the matched files laid out exactly as the incoming torrent expects, then adds the torrent pointing at that hardlink tree. This can make cross-seed alignment simpler and faster, because qBittorrent can start seeding immediately without file rename alignment.

## When to Use

- You want cross-seeds to have their own on-disk directory structure (per tracker / per instance / flat), while still sharing data blocks with the original download.
- You want to avoid qBittorrent rename-alignment and hash rechecks for layout differences.

## Requirements

- Requires **Local filesystem access** on the target qBittorrent instance.
- Hardlink base directory must be on the **same filesystem/volume** as the instance's download paths (hardlinks can't cross filesystems).
- qui must be able to read the instance's content paths and write to the hardlink base directory.

:::tip Multi-filesystem setups
If your downloads span multiple filesystems (e.g., `/mnt/disk1`, `/mnt/disk2`), you can specify **multiple base directories** separated by commas. qui will automatically select the first directory that's on the same filesystem as the source files.

Example: `/mnt/disk1/cross-seed, /mnt/disk2/cross-seed, /mnt/disk3/cross-seed`

## Behavior

- Hardlink mode is a **per-instance setting** (not per request). Each qBittorrent instance can have its own hardlink configuration.
- Torrents added via hardlink/reflink mode always use an explicit `savepath` (the link-tree root), which forces **AutoTMM off**. Enabling AutoTMM after adding can move files out of the link tree.
- By default, if a hardlink cannot be created (no local access, filesystem mismatch, invalid base dir, etc.), the cross-seed **fails**.
- Enable **"Fallback to regular mode"** to allow failed hardlink operations to use regular cross-seed mode instead of failing. Filesystem fallback uses a full recheck; see [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md#when-rechecks-are-required-reuse-mode).
- When fallback handles a partial or otherwise non-perfect match, qui runs a piece-boundary safety check before adding the torrent to qBittorrent. This fallback check is always enforced, even if **Skip piece boundary safety check** is enabled for regular reuse mode.
- Hardlinked torrents are still categorized using your existing cross-seed category rules (category affix, indexer name, or custom category); the hardlink preset only affects on-disk folder layout.

## Directory Layout

Configure in Cross-Seed → Hardlink Mode → (select instance):

- **Hardlink base directory**: Path(s) on the qui host where hardlink trees are created. For multi-filesystem setups, specify multiple paths separated by commas (e.g., `/mnt/disk1/cross-seed, /mnt/disk2/cross-seed`).
- **Directory preset**:
  - `flat`: `base/TorrentName--shortHash/...`
  - `by-tracker`: `base/<tracker>/TorrentName--shortHash/...`
  - `by-instance`: `base/<instance>/TorrentName--shortHash/...`

### Isolation Folders

For `by-tracker` and `by-instance` presets, qui determines whether an isolation folder is needed based on the torrent's file structure:

- **Torrents with a root folder** (e.g., `Movie/video.mkv`, `Movie/subs.srt`) → files already have a common top-level directory, no isolation folder needed
- **Rootless torrents** (e.g., `video.mkv`, `subs.srt` at top level) → isolation folder added to prevent file conflicts

When an isolation folder is needed, it uses a human-readable format: `<TorrentName--shortHash>` (e.g., `My.Movie.2024.1080p.BluRay--abcdef12`).

For the `flat` preset, an isolation folder is always used to keep each torrent's files separated.

## How to Enable

1. Enable "Local filesystem access" on the qBittorrent instance in Instance Settings.
2. In Cross-Seed → Hardlink Mode, expand the instance you want to configure.
3. Enable "Hardlink mode" for that instance.
4. Set "Hardlink base directory":
   - Single filesystem: `/mnt/data/cross-seed`
   - Multiple filesystems: `/mnt/disk1/cross-seed, /mnt/disk2/cross-seed, /mnt/disk3/cross-seed`
5. Choose a directory preset (`flat`, `by-tracker`, `by-instance`).
6. Optionally enable "Fallback to regular mode" if you want failed hardlinks to use regular cross-seed mode instead of failing.

## Pause Behavior

By default, hardlink-added torrents start seeding immediately (since `skip_checking=true` means they're at 100% instantly). If you want hardlink-added torrents to remain paused, enable the "Skip auto-resume" option for your cross-seed source (Completion, RSS, Webhook, etc.).

When hardlink/reflink mode creates a complete link tree with no extra files to download, qui adds the torrent with hash checking skipped and does not trigger an automatic recheck. If qBittorrent instead reports `missing files`, see [Hardlink/reflink cross-seed shows "missing files"](./troubleshooting.md#hardlinkreflink-cross-seed-shows-missing-files).

When the incoming torrent has extra files that are not present in the matched torrent, qui adds the torrent paused, triggers a recheck, and resumes it only after qBittorrent reports progress at or above the configured threshold.

If hardlink/reflink mode falls back to regular mode for a partial or non-perfect match, the fallback add is stricter: qui first checks piece boundaries, then adds the torrent paused only when the check passes. Safe fallback adds require a full 100% recheck before auto-resume.

## Notes

- Hardlinks share disk blocks with the original file but increase the link count. Deleting one link does not necessarily free space until all links are removed.
- Windows support: folder names are sanitized to remove characters Windows forbids. Torrent file paths themselves still need to be valid for your qBittorrent setup.
- Hardlink mode supports extra files when piece-boundary safe. If the incoming torrent contains extra files not present in the matched torrent (e.g., `.nfo`/`.srt` sidecars), hardlink mode will link the content files and trigger a recheck so qBittorrent downloads the extras. If extras share pieces with content (unsafe), the cross-seed is skipped.
- Partial matches (e.g., season packs where only some episodes are on disk) require the **Download missing files** setting to be enabled in [Dir Scan settings](./dir-scan.md#settings-global). Without it, partial link tree injections are rejected.

## Deleting Hardlinked Cross-Seeds

The delete dialog's cross-seed check detects hardlinked copies: matches whose files are verified by filesystem identity to be hardlinks of the deleted torrent's files, even when they live in a different save path. Detected copies appear in the affected list with a **Hardlink** badge and can be deleted along with the selection via **Also delete these cross-seeded torrents**.

Because hardlinked copies keep their own links to the data, deleting the original's files does not break them and does not free disk space — the space is only reclaimed once all remaining links are removed. The dialog's warning text reflects this.

Detection requires:

- **Local filesystem access** enabled on the instance(s) — qui must run where qBittorrent's save paths are valid, same as the requirements above. Without it, only same-path cross-seeds are detected.
- The copy's torrent name must match the original by name or release metadata. Copies renamed beyond recognition are not detected.

If a copy cannot be verified (for example its file list is temporarily unavailable), the check fails visibly instead of reporting "no cross-seeds found".

On Windows, the same delete check also detects ReFS block-cloned files and displays a **Reflink** badge. This is a bounded verification step, not a disk scan:

- Only torrents already matched by exact name or release metadata are considered.
- Only files listed by qBittorrent for those torrents are examined. qui does not enumerate the volume, scan unrelated directories, query block reference counts, or calculate reclaimable space.
- Source and candidate files must be on the same ReFS volume and report block-cloning support.
- Files are paired by exact case-insensitive normalized relative path and qBittorrent-reported size. When layouts differ, an exact basename-and-size fallback is used only if that key is unique in both torrents.
- Zero-length, missing, symbolic/reparse-point link, directory, and unsafe traversal paths are skipped.

The ReFS check compares current allocated disk extents. It proves that at least one allocated cluster is shared at the time of the check; it does not prove clone history or imply that every byte is still shared. Copy-on-write can leave only part of a file shared after modification. A clone cannot be detected after all formerly shared clusters have been rewritten.

Files smaller than one ReFS allocation cluster may have no cloned extent because qui's Windows reflink implementation copies the non-cluster-aligned tail. Those files cannot provide ReFS shared-extent evidence.

## Reflink Mode (Alternative)

Reflink mode creates copy-on-write clones of the matched files. Unlike hardlinks, reflinks allow qBittorrent to safely modify the cloned files (download missing pieces, repair corrupted data) without affecting the original seeded files.

**Key advantage:** Reflink mode **bypasses piece-boundary safety checks**. This means you can cross-seed torrents with extra/missing files even when those files share pieces with existing content—the clones can be safely modified.

### When to Use Reflink Mode

- You want to cross-seed torrents that hardlink mode would skip due to "extra files share pieces with content"
- Your filesystem supports copy-on-write clones (BTRFS, XFS on Linux; APFS on macOS; ReFS on Windows)
- You prefer the safety of copy-on-write over hardlinks

### Reflink Requirements

- **Local filesystem access** must be enabled on the target qBittorrent instance.
- The base directory must be on the **same filesystem/volume** as the instance's download paths. For multi-filesystem setups, specify multiple paths separated by commas.
- The base directory must be a **real filesystem mount**, not a pooled/virtual mount (common examples: `mergerfs`, other FUSE mounts, `overlayfs`).
- The filesystem must support reflinks:
  - **Linux**: BTRFS, XFS (with reflink=1), and similar CoW filesystems
  - **macOS**: APFS
  - **Windows**: ReFS on the same volume as the source files and reflink base directory
  - **FreeBSD**: Not currently supported

:::note
Windows reflink mode uses ReFS block cloning (requiring a ReFS filesystem). NTFS is not supported. If the matched source path is a symlink, qui resolves it before cloning, and the resolved source plus the reflink base directory still need to be on the same ReFS volume. If reflink creation fails, fallback still depends on the existing "Fallback to regular mode" setting.
:::

:::tip
On Linux, check the filesystem type with `df -T /path` (you want `xfs`/`btrfs`, not `fuseblk`/`fuse.mergerfs`/`overlayfs`).

### Behavior Differences

| Aspect | Hardlink Mode | Reflink Mode |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Piece-boundary check | Skips if unsafe | Never skips (safe to modify clones) |
| Recheck | Only when extras or disc layouts require verification | Only when extras or disc layouts require verification |
| Disk usage | Zero (shared blocks) | Starts near-zero; grows as modified |

### Disk Usage Implications

Reflinks use copy-on-write semantics:
- Initially, cloned files share disk blocks with originals (near-zero additional space)
- When qBittorrent writes to a clone (downloads extras, repairs pieces), only modified blocks are copied
- In worst case (entire file rewritten), disk usage approaches full file size

### How to Enable Reflink Mode

1. Enable "Local filesystem access" on the qBittorrent instance in Instance Settings.
2. In Cross-Seed > Hardlink / Reflink Mode, expand the instance you want to configure.
3. Enable "Reflink mode" for that instance.
4. Set "Base directory":
   - Single filesystem: `/mnt/data/cross-seed`
   - Multiple filesystems: `/mnt/disk1/cross-seed, /mnt/disk2/cross-seed`
5. Choose a directory preset (`flat`, `by-tracker`, `by-instance`).
6. Optionally enable "Fallback to regular mode" if you want failed reflinks to use regular cross-seed mode instead of failing.

:::note
Hardlink and reflink modes are mutually exclusive—only one can be enabled per instance.
