# Directory Scanner

Directory Scanner (Dir Scan) scans local folders to find cross-seed opportunities for content already on disk. Unlike Library Scan (which queries qBittorrent's torrent list), Dir Scan works directly with files on the filesystem.

Configure it in **Cross-Seed > Dir Scan**.

## Requirements

- At least one qBittorrent instance must have **Local filesystem access** enabled in Instance Settings.
- qui must be able to read the files directly (same host or shared mounts as the target qBittorrent instance).
- Prowlarr or Jackett must be configured with at least one enabled indexer.
- Optional: Sonarr/Radarr configured in **Settings > Integrations** for external ID lookups (IMDb/TMDb/TVDb).

## How to Choose Your Scan Path

Dir Scan treats each **immediate child** of your configured path as one "searchee." It does not treat the path itself as a single searchee, and it does not recurse into subfolders to create additional searchees.

**Example:** If you configure `/data/media/movies`:

```plaintext
/data/media/movies/
├── Movie.2024.1080p.BluRay/   <- searchee 1
│   ├── movie.mkv
│   └── movie.nfo
├── Another.Movie.2023.2160p/  <- searchee 2
│   └── movie.mkv
└── standalone.mkv             <- searchee 3
```

Each immediate child (folder or file) becomes one searchee. Files within `Movie.2024.1080p.BluRay/` are grouped together as part of that searchee.

### Correct path choices

| Content type | Recommended path | Why |
|-------------|------------------|-----|
| Movies | `/data/media/movies` | Each movie folder is one searchee |
| TV Shows | `/data/media/tv` | Each show folder is one searchee |
| Music | `/data/media/music` | Each album folder is one searchee |

### Incorrect path choices

| Path | Problem |
|------|---------|
| `/data/media` containing `movies/` + `tv/` + `music/` | Only 3 searchees total (the category folders themselves) |
| `/data/media/movies/Movie.2024.1080p.BluRay` | Only 1 searchee; scans that specific movie only |

:::tip
Create one Dir Scan entry per category folder. Don't point at a parent folder containing multiple category subfolders.

## Docker and Path Mapping

When qui and qBittorrent run in separate containers or see different mount points, you need path mapping.

### "Local filesystem access" explained

Enabling **Local filesystem access** on a qBittorrent instance tells qui:
1. qui can read files directly from the filesystem (same paths or mapped paths).
2. qui should use file-based matching (inode checks, size verification) rather than relying solely on qBittorrent's API.

This requires qui to have read access to the actual files, either on the same host or via shared network/volume mounts.

### Recommended: Use the same volume paths

The simplest setup is to mount volumes at the same path in both containers:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  qui:
    volumes:
      - /mnt/storage:/mnt/storage

  qbittorrent:
    volumes:
      - /mnt/storage:/mnt/storage
```

When both containers see `/data/media/movies`, no path mapping is needed. Leave **qBittorrent Path Prefix** empty.

### Path mapping example (different mount points)

Your setup:
- qui container mounts: `-v /mnt/storage:/data`
- qBittorrent container mounts: `-v /mnt/storage:/downloads`

qui sees files at `/data/media/movies/Movie.2024/movie.mkv`
qBittorrent sees the same file at `/downloads/media/movies/Movie.2024/movie.mkv`

Configure Dir Scan:
- **Directory Path**: `/data/media/movies`
- **qBittorrent Path Prefix**: `/downloads/media/movies`

When qui finds a match, it tells qBittorrent to add the torrent pointing at `/downloads/media/movies/Movie.2024/` instead of `/data/media/movies/Movie.2024/`.

## How It Works

For each configured scan directory, qui:

1. Enumerates immediate children of the directory path.
2. For each child (folder or file), recursively collects all files within.
3. Groups files into a "searchee" with parsed release info.
4. Uses configured *arr instances to resolve external IDs when possible.
5. Searches enabled indexers via Torznab.
6. Downloads torrent files and matches their file lists against what's on disk.
7. If a match is found, adds the torrent to the target qBittorrent instance.

:::note Categories + AutoTMM
Dir Scan adds torrents using an explicit `savepath` to point qBittorrent at the existing files on disk. That forces **AutoTMM off** for Dir Scan injections.

Dir Scan categories come only from **Dir Scan → Default Category** and per-directory **Category override**. Cross-Seed → Rules category modes (affix / indexer / custom) do not apply to Dir Scan.

If you later enable AutoTMM on an injected torrent, qBittorrent may relocate files based on its default save path + category rules.
:::

:::info
Torznab searches run through the shared scheduler at background priority, so they queue behind interactive, RSS, and completion cross-seed work.

If the global scan concurrency limit is reached, new scans show as `queued` until a scan slot is available.
Dir Scan may also pause between downloading candidate torrent files from an indexer. This is intentional and helps avoid hammering Prowlarr/indexers (especially for private trackers), but it can make scans take longer when many candidates need checking.
:::

### Already-seeding detection

Dir Scan maintains a FileID index (inode + device on Unix) to track files already present in qBittorrent. It skips:
- Files that are already part of a seeding torrent
- Torrents whose infohash already exists in qBittorrent

This avoids redundant searches and duplicate additions.

If a torrent is removed from qBittorrent (for example, by an automation rule that removes torrents with missing files), its files are no longer tracked in the index. The next scan of whichever directory contains those files will treat them as new searchees and search indexers for them again.

### Recheck Behavior

- **Full matches**: Torrent is added with "skip hash check" enabled. Seeding starts immediately.
- **Partial matches** (when enabled): Torrent is added without skipping hash check. qBittorrent verifies existing data and downloads missing files.

## What Gets Scanned

### Included file types

**Video:** `.mkv`, `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.m4v`, `.wmv`, `.mov`, `.ts`, `.m2ts`, `.vob`, `.mpg`, `.mpeg`, `.webm`, `.flv`

**Audio:** `.flac`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aac`, `.ogg`, `.m4a`, `.wma`, `.ape`, `.alac`, `.dsd`, `.dsf`, `.dff`

**Extras:** `.nfo`, `.sfv`, `.srt`, `.sub`, `.idx`, `.ass`, `.ssa`

Extras are included in releases and can affect partial-match behavior (a torrent with an `.nfo` you don't have may trigger a partial match instead of full).

### Disc layouts

Folders containing `BDMV/`, `VIDEO_TS/`, or `AUDIO_TS/` structures are treated as disc-based media. All files within these structures are included regardless of extension.

### Skipped items

- **Hidden files and folders** (names starting with `.`)
- **Symlinks** (explicitly skipped to avoid loops and permission issues)
- **Files with permission errors** (scan continues, file is skipped)
- **Non-media files** outside disc layouts

## Settings (Global)

Open **Dir Scan > Settings**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Match Mode | `Strict` matches by filename + exact file size. `Flexible` ignores filenames for primary matching, but matched files must still have the same exact file size. |
| Size Tolerance (%) | Allows small differences in total torrent size when filtering candidates before file matching. |
| Minimum Piece Ratio (%) | For partial matches, minimum percent of torrent data that must exist on disk. |
| Max searchees per run | Limits how many eligible searchees are processed per run. `0` = unlimited. Useful for making progress across restarts. |
| Only process items changed within the last (days) | Excludes stale work items before search. Uses video/audio mtimes only for manual/scheduled scans. Webhook-triggered scans ignore this cutoff. `0` = disabled. |
| Allow partial matches | Add torrents even if they have extra/missing files compared to disk. |
| Download missing files | Downloads files not found on disk for partial matches. Required for season packs and partial releases in hardlink/reflink mode. Enabled by default. |
| Skip piece boundary safety check | Allow partial matches where downloading missing files could modify pieces containing existing content. |
| Start torrents paused | Add injected torrents in paused state. |
| Default Category / Tags | Applied to all injected torrents. Directory-level settings add to these. |

In practice:

- **Strict** is best when filenames on disk are still close to the release layout.
- **Flexible** is best for renamed libraries, but it still requires exact file-size matches for the files it pairs.
- **Size Tolerance** only affects which search results are considered based on **total torrent size**. It does **not** allow per-file size mismatches.
- Flexible single-file matches may still be rejected when the candidate lacks corroborating title or external ID evidence. This prevents false positives when an indexer falls back from ID-based search to plain title search.

### "Max searchees per run" explained

This setting limits how many **top-level folders/files** Dir Scan will process in a single run.

- If your directory is a TV root like `/mnt/storage/media/tv`, then each **show folder** is one searchee (for example `Show.Name/`, `Another.Show/`).
- If your directory is a movies root like `/mnt/storage/media/movies`, then each **movie folder** is one searchee (for example `Movie.Title (2024)/`, `Another.Movie (2023)/`).

So if **Max searchees per run = 5**, Dir Scan will process up to **5 show folders** (TV) or **5 movie folders** (movies) per run, then stop and persist per-file progress for the next run. The next run rechecks the directory, skips already-final files, and retries unfinished work. See [Incremental progress and resets](#incremental-progress-and-resets).

This is **not** a cap on the total number of indexer searches. TV folders can trigger multiple searches (season-level + per-episode heuristics), even though they still count as a single top-level searchee.

### "Only process items changed within the last (days)" explained

This setting reduces tracker/API load by excluding stale content before search begins.

- Movies/music are included only when the item's newest video/audio file is within the cutoff.
- TV is evaluated at the season/episode work-item level so one fresh episode does not pull an entire older show back in.
- Season-pack searches are kept only when all episode files in that season work item are within the cutoff; otherwise qui falls back to fresh episode-level work only. With [Skip individual episodes](#skip-individual-episodes) on, there is no episode-level fallback, so the season pack stays in scope as long as its newest episode is within the cutoff.
- Cutoff is computed as `now - N days` (for example, `7` means “older than 7 days”).
- The timestamp used is filesystem **modified time (mtime)** from video/audio files only, not subtitles, extras, release date, or qBittorrent add time.
- Webhook-triggered scans ignore the cutoff entirely and trust the webhook path as the freshness signal.
- `0` disables age filtering.

Example with `7` days:

- `Movie.2024/` has only an `.srt` updated yesterday while the `.mkv` is old -> skipped.
- `Show.Name/Season 01/` has one fresh episode and nine old ones -> only the fresh episode stays in scope.
- `Old.Show.S01/` has all episode files older than 7 days -> skipped.

## Directories

Each scan directory has its own configuration:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Directory Path | The path qui scans (immediate children become searchees). |
| qBittorrent Path Prefix | Path mapping for container setups. See [Docker and Path Mapping](#docker-and-path-mapping). |
| Target qBittorrent Instance | Where matched torrents are added. Must have Local filesystem access enabled. |
| Category override | Overrides the global Default Category for this directory. |
| Additional tags | Added on top of the global Dir Scan tags. |
| Scan Interval (minutes) | How often to rescan (minimum 60 minutes, default 1440 = 24 hours). |
| Skip individual episodes | The scan does not search single TV episodes. See [Skip individual episodes](#skip-individual-episodes). |
| Enabled | Enable/disable without deleting the configuration. |

### Skip individual episodes

Off by default. When it is on, the scan does not search single TV episodes. It searches the season pack that the episodes make together instead. Movies, music, and other content are not affected.

A season pack search needs two or more episodes of the same show and season. The scan groups these episodes across the whole searchee, not per subfolder. If a folder holds episodes from more than one season, the scan makes no pack for those seasons. The scan does not search an episode that cannot make a season pack.

This option does not affect specials (season 0) or absolute episode numbers.

## Operational Behavior

### Concurrent scans

Only one scan runs per directory at a time. If a scheduled scan triggers while another scan is running, it will not start a second run for that directory.

### Incremental progress and resets

Dir Scan persists per-file progress and skips unchanged searchees whose files are already in a final state (matched/no match/already seeding/in qBittorrent).

This is **not** an exact checkpoint resume. When you start a new run after canceling or restarting qui, Dir Scan:

- rechecks the directory from the top
- keeps finished files skipped if they are unchanged
- retries unfinished or errored files

From a user perspective, this behaves like **restart with preserved progress**, not “continue from the exact file where it stopped.”

### New indexers reopen "no match" files

Each "no match" file records which indexers were enabled when the search ran. When you enable an indexer that is not in that record, the next scan searches the file again. You do not need to reset anything. An indexer that was already in the record does not trigger a retry, because the file was searched against it before.

A search only marks a file as "no match" when every indexer it asked answered. If some indexers were down or rate-limited, the file stays pending and the next scan retries it.

Files marked "no match" on older qui versions have no recorded indexer set. They stay skipped until you requeue them (see below).

### Retry Unmatched vs Reset Scan Progress

Both buttons sit on the directory details card, next to the run history.

- **Retry Unmatched** resets only "no match" files to pending. Matched and already-seeding files keep their state. Use this after you add an indexer and want old "no match" files searched again.
- **Reset Scan Progress** deletes all tracked file state for the directory. The next scan re-processes everything, including files that already matched. Use this only when you want a full redo.

Neither button starts a scan. Trigger a scan with **Scan Now**, or wait for the next scheduled run.

### Scheduled vs manual scans

- **Scheduled scans** run based on the configured interval (minimum 60 minutes).
- **Manual scans** can be triggered from the UI at any time via the "Scan Now" button.

Both types can be canceled from the UI while running.

The UI keeps the **last 10 run entries** per directory. Older run rows are pruned automatically.

### Webhook trigger

You can trigger a scan automatically when Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, or Readarr imports content. The webhook endpoint natively understands *arr webhook payloads — no custom scripts needed.

```http
POST /api/dir-scan/webhook/scan?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY
```

qui extracts the path from the *arr payload (`series.path`, `movie.folderPath`, `artist.path`, or `author.path`), matches it against the Dir Scan **Directory Path** values configured in qui, and uses the provided path itself as the scan root. It does not use qBittorrent path prefixes for this lookup. On success, the response includes `runId`, `directoryId`, `directoryPath`, and `scanRoot`.

Each Dir Scan directory can also define **Allowed Download Clients**. When set, native *arr webhook scans only run if the webhook `downloadClient` matches one of those names. Leave the list empty to accept all clients. Matching is case-insensitive and trims surrounding whitespace. Direct simple-mode `{"path": ...}` callers are not filtered by download client.

#### Setting up in Sonarr / Radarr

1. Go to **Settings → Connect → Add → Webhook**.
2. Set **Name** to something like `qui Dir Scan`.
3. Under **Notification Triggers**, enable **On File Import**. Optionally enable **On File Upgrade** if you also want scans after upgrades. In Sonarr, **On Import Complete** also works.
4. Set **Webhook URL** to:
   ```text
   http://your-qui-host:7476/api/dir-scan/webhook/scan?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```
5. Set **Method** to `POST`.
6. Leave **Username** and **Password** empty (auth is handled by the API key in the URL).
7. Click **Test** or **Save**. The built-in **Test** action is accepted as a no-op health check and does not start a scan.

The same steps apply to Lidarr and Readarr.

:::tip
The webhook uses query-param API key authentication (`?apikey=...`), the same pattern as the cross-seed webhook. You can also use the `X-API-Key` header instead.
:::

#### How path matching works

qui uses longest-prefix matching against the configured Dir Scan **Directory Path** values to choose which directory settings apply. The actual scan root is the path from the webhook payload. For example, if you have directories configured for `/data/media/movies` and `/data/media/tv`, and Sonarr sends `series.path: "/data/media/tv/Show Name"`, qui matches `/data/media/tv` and scans `/data/media/tv/Show Name`.

In split-mount setups, the *arr app must send the same library path that qui sees on disk. If Sonarr/Radarr uses a different mount path than qui, the webhook will not find a matching directory.

#### Response codes

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `200` | Webhook accepted but skipped by directory filters. Example: `{"skipped": true, "reason": "download client not allowed"}` |
| `202` | Scan accepted. If the directory is idle, qui starts the run immediately. If a webhook scan is already running for that directory, qui keeps one follow-up queued run and merges later webhook paths into it. Example: `{"runId": 42, "directoryId": 3, "directoryPath": "/data/media/tv", "scanRoot": "/data/media/tv/Show Name"}` |
| `204` | Test webhook accepted. No scan started |
| `400` | Invalid JSON payload, or no supported path field was found in the request body |
| `404` | No enabled directory matches the path in the payload |
| `409` | Request conflicts with directory state, such as multiple matching directories |
| `500` | Internal server error — scan could not be started due to an internal failure |

If a second webhook arrives while the same directory is already scanning, qui returns `202` again. It does not reject the request or require client-side retries. Instead, it updates one queued follow-up run for that directory and expands the queued `scanRoot` to the nearest common ancestor when needed.

Webhook-triggered scans also ignore the global age cutoff. This avoids false skips when Sonarr/Radarr imports files that preserve old filesystem mtimes.

#### Allowed download clients

Use **Allowed Download Clients** on a Dir Scan directory when only specific Sonarr/Radarr clients should trigger scans for that path.

- Leave it empty to allow all webhook clients.
- Add exact client names as shown in Sonarr or Radarr, such as `SABnzbd`, `NZBGet`, or `qBittorrent`.
- Matching is case-insensitive and ignores leading/trailing whitespace.
- If the webhook is otherwise valid but the client is missing or not allowed, qui returns `200` and skips starting a scan.
- Direct simple-mode callers using `{"path": ...}` bypass this filter because they do not provide *arr download client metadata.

#### Simple mode

You can also call the webhook directly with a plain path (useful for scripts or other tools):

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7476/api/dir-scan/webhook/scan?apikey=YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path": "/data/media/movies/Movie Name (2024)"}'
```

### Scan phases

Each scan progresses through phases:

1. **Scanning** - Reading directory contents and building searchee list
2. **Searching** - Querying indexers for each searchee
3. **Injecting** - Adding matched torrents to qBittorrent
4. **Final state** - Success, Failed, or Canceled

The UI shows current phase and progress during active scans.

## Hardlink/Reflink Modes

If the target qBittorrent instance has hardlink or reflink mode enabled, Dir Scan uses the same behavior as other cross-seed methods:

- Builds a link tree matching the incoming torrent's layout.
- Adds the torrent pointing at that tree (`contentLayout=Original`). Full matches use `skip_checking=true`; partial matches allow qBittorrent to verify existing data and download missing files safely into the link tree.

:::note
Partial matches in link tree mode (hardlink or reflink) require **Download missing files** to be enabled in Dir Scan settings. Without it, partial link tree injections are rejected.
:::

See:
- [Hardlink Mode](./hardlink-mode.md)
- [Link Directories](./link-directories.md)

### Fallback to regular mode

When link-tree creation fails (hardlinking across filesystems, permission issues), Dir Scan falls back to regular add behavior **if** the instance has **Fallback to regular mode** enabled. Otherwise, the candidate fails.

Filesystem fallback adds the torrent against the matched source files instead of the link-tree directory, so qui requires a full 100% recheck before auto-resume. If **Skip recheck** is enabled, the fallback candidate is skipped.

For partial or otherwise non-perfect fallback matches, qui runs piece-boundary protection before adding the torrent. This fallback check is always enforced, even when **Skip piece boundary safety check** is enabled for regular reuse mode.

## Scanning Your *arr Library

Dir Scan can scan Sonarr/Radarr library folders, but be careful with partial matches:

:::warning
With **Allow partial matches** enabled, qBittorrent may download missing files (extras like `.nfo`, subtitles) directly into your *arr-managed library folder. This can create unexpected files alongside your media.
:::

For a "read-only" scan of your library:
1. Disable **Allow partial matches** (full matches only).
2. Disable **Fallback to regular mode** on the target instance so hardlink failures don't add torrents directly against your library path.

The safer setup is usually:
- Scan your completed downloads/staging folder instead of the final library, and/or
- Use hardlink/reflink mode so cross-seeds live under your configured link-tree base directory.

## Troubleshooting

### Recent Scan Runs

The **Recent Scan Runs** panel on the Dir Scan page shows:
- Added count (successful injections)
- Failed count (matches that couldn't be added)
- Timestamps and duration

Click a run to see details including failure reasons for individual items.

### Common issues

**No results found:**
- Verify at least one indexer is enabled and not rate-limited.
- Check that the scan path contains valid media files.
- Ensure the target instance has Local filesystem access enabled.

**Permissions errors:**
- qui must have read access to the scan path.
- Check container volume mounts if running in Docker.

**Wrong path mapping:**
- Verify qBittorrent Path Prefix matches how qBittorrent sees the same files.
- Test by checking a torrent's save path in qBittorrent's UI.

**Rate limiting:**
- Indexers may throttle requests. Check **Scheduler Activity** on the Indexers page.
- Consider reducing scan frequency or limiting to fewer indexers.

For cross-seed-wide issues (matching behavior, hardlink failures, recheck problems), see [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md).
