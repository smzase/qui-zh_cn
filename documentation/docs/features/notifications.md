# Notifications

qui supports both the Notifiarr API and Shoutrrr targets. Configure one or more targets in **Settings → Notifications** and choose which events to send.

## Setup

1. Open **Settings → Notifications**.
2. Add a target name and URL.
3. Pick the events you want.
4. Save and use **Test** to verify delivery.

Notes:
- Existing targets keep their saved event list when new events are introduced.
- Messages may be truncated to keep notifications short and avoid provider limits.
- Discord and Notifiarr targets use rich embeds with fields; other services receive plain text.

## Event types

## Notifiarr API

For prettier output similar to Discord embeds, use the native Notifiarr API scheme:

- `notifiarrapi://apikey`
- Optional override: `notifiarrapi://apikey?endpoint=https://notifiarr.com/api/v1/notification/qui`

## Shoutrrr URLs

Use any Shoutrrr-supported URL scheme. A few examples:

- `discord://token@channel`
- `notifiarr://apikey`
- `slack://token@channel`
- `telegram://token@telegram?chats=chat-id`
- `gotify://host/token`

Notifiarr can also include optional parameters such as `channel` or `name`, e.g. `notifiarr://apikey?name=qui&channel=123456789`.
