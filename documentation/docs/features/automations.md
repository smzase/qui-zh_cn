# Automations

Automations are a rule-based engine that automatically applies actions to torrents based on conditions. Use them to manage speed limits, delete old torrents, organize with tags and categories, and more.

## How Automations Work

Automations are evaluated in **sort order** (first match wins for exclusive actions like delete). Each rule can match torrents using a flexible query builder with nested conditions.

- **Automatic** - Background service scans torrents every 20 seconds
- **Per-Rule Intervals** - Each rule can have its own interval (minimum 60 seconds, default 15 minutes)
- **Per-Rule Notifications** - If notification targets are configured, each rule can opt in or out of sending automation notifications
- **Manual** - Click "Apply Now" to trigger immediately (bypasses interval checks)
- **Manual dry-run** - Run "Dry-run now" from the workflow dialog or "Run dry-run now" from the workflow menu
- **Debouncing** - Same torrent won't be re-processed within 2 minutes

## Query Builder

The query builder supports complex nested conditions with AND/OR groups. Drag conditions to reorder them.

| `unregistered` | Tracker reports unregistered |

### Operators

**String:** equals, not equals, contains, not contains, starts with, ends with, matches regex

**Numeric:** `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, between

**Boolean:** is, is not

**State:** is, is not

**Cross-Category (Name field only):**

- `EXISTS_IN` - Exact name match in target category
- `CONTAINS_IN` - Partial/normalized name match in target category

### Regex Support

There are two ways to use regex in filter conditions:

**The `matches regex` operator** is a dedicated operator where the value is always treated as a regex pattern. The condition is true if the pattern matches anywhere in the field value.

**The regex toggle (`.*` button)** appears next to the value input on other string operators such as `equals`, `contains`, `not contains`, `starts with`, and `ends with`. When enabled, the value is treated as a regex pattern.

:::warning Regex toggle overrides the selected operator

When the regex toggle is enabled, the selected operator's logic (negation, containment, prefix/suffix matching) is **not applied**. The condition becomes a simple regex match, equivalent to `matches regex`, regardless of which operator is selected in the dropdown.

This means `not contains` with the regex toggle enabled does **not** negate the match. It behaves the same as `matches regex` -- if the pattern is found, the condition evaluates to true.

To negate a regex match, use the **NOT toggle** (the `IF / IF NOT` button at the start of the condition row) together with the `matches regex` operator.
:::

Full RE2 (Go regex) syntax is supported. Patterns are case-insensitive by default.

Regex can be used either by selecting **matches regex** or by enabling the **Regex** toggle for a condition:

- When regex is enabled, the condition checks whether the regex matches the field value.
- `not equals` and `not contains` invert the regex result (true only if the regex does **not** match).
- Operators like `equals`, `contains`, `starts with`, and `ends with` are treated as regex match when regex is enabled.
- Regex is not implicitly anchored: use `^` and `$` if you want an exact/full-string match (example: `^BHD$`).

Field notes:

- **Tracker**: checked against multiple candidates (raw URL, extracted domain, and optional customization display name). Negative regex passes only if **none** of the candidates match.
- **Tags**: without regex, string operators are applied per-tag. With regex enabled, the regex is matched against the full raw tags string.

The UI validates patterns and shows helpful error messages for invalid regex.

### Tag conditions

Each tag condition checks against a **single value**. The value field does not support comma-separated lists -- if you enter `tag1, tag2, tag3` as the value, it will be treated as one literal string, not three separate tags.

Without regex enabled, tag operators (`equals`, `not equals`, `contains`, `not contains`) compare the condition value against each of the torrent's tags individually.

- `equals` / `not equals`: exact tag membership (case-insensitive)
- `contains` / `not contains`: substring match per tag (case-insensitive)

:::warning Tag operators: `contains` is substring matching
`Tags contains tag1` will also match torrents tagged `tag10`. For exact tag membership, prefer `equals` / `not equals` with one condition per tag and combine them with an **OR group**.
:::

#### Matching any of multiple tags

To check whether a torrent has **any one of** several tags, create an **OR group** with one condition per tag (exact match):

| #   | Field | Operator | Value |
| --- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| 1   | Tags  | equals   | tag1  |
| 2   | Tags  | equals   | tag2  |
| 3   | Tags  | equals   | tag3  |

Group these with **OR** logic so the rule matches when at least one tag is present.

To **exclude** torrents that have any of several tags, create an **AND group** of `not equals` conditions (exact match):

| #   | Field | Operator   | Value |
| --- | ----- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1   | Tags  | not equals | tag1  |
| 2   | Tags  | not equals | tag2  |
| 3   | Tags  | not equals | tag3  |

Group these with **AND** logic -- all three must be true, meaning none of those tags are present.

#### Using regex for tag matching

As an alternative to multiple conditions, you can use regex to match against several tags in a single condition. When regex is enabled, the pattern matches against the **full raw tag string** (e.g. `cross-seed, noHL, racing`) rather than checking each tag individually.

For example, to exclude torrents tagged with `tag1` or `tag2`, use a single condition:

- Field: `Tags`
- Toggle: `IF NOT` (negate the match)
- Operator: `matches regex`
- Value: `(^|,\s*)(tag1|tag2)(\s*,|$)`

This evaluates the regex against the raw tags string. The delimiter-aware pattern ensures `tag1` does not match `tag10`. The `IF NOT` toggle then negates the result, so the condition is true only for torrents that do **not** have either tag.

### Live impact preview and dry-run

Workflow editing includes immediate feedback for delete/category workflows:

- **Live impact preview** in the workflow dialog updates automatically as conditions/actions change.
- Shows current **impacted count** plus a small preview list of matching torrents.
- For category rules, the preview summary splits direct matches and cross-seed expansions.

You can also run dry-runs immediately without waiting for interval execution:

- **Workflow dialog:** `Dry-run now`
- **Workflow list menu:** `Run dry-run now`

Dry-run executes the current workflow config as a simulation only and writes results to automation activity.

No-match behavior:

- Manual dry-runs still log a `dry_run_no_match` summary row when nothing matches.
- Scheduled dry-run rules do **not** log no-match rows (to avoid event noise).

## Torrent Sorting & Scoring

By default, torrents matched by an automation are processed oldest-first. However, you can customize the **Torrent Priority** to control exactly which torrents are processed first. This is useful for actions like **Delete** combined with **Free Space**, where the priority determines which torrents are removed first to free up space.

### Priority Types

| Type       | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Default**| Standard oldest-first priority.                                                                                     |
| **Simple** | Prioritize by a single numeric, duration, or string field (e.g., `Size`, `Added Age`, `Name`) in ascending or descending order.                           |
| **Score**  | Advanced rule-based priority. Torrents are scored based on custom rules, and prioritized in ascending or descending order of their total score. |

### Score-Based Priority

Score-based priority allows you to rank torrents using multiple combined factors. You define **Score Rules** that evaluate each torrent and contribute to its total score.

Available score rule types:
- **Field Multiplier**: Extracts a numeric value from the torrent (like `Size` or `Time Active`), multiplies it by a specified multiplier, and adds it to the score.
- **Conditional**: Evaluates a standard query condition (see [Query Builder](#query-builder)). If the condition is true, a static value is added to the score.

Torrents are then processed by their final computed score. The computed scores are displayed in the **Live impact preview** so you can verify your scoring logic.

## Tracker Matching

This is sort of not needed, since you can already scope trackers outside the workflows. But its available either way.

| Pattern | Example               | Matches               |
| ------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| All     | `*`                   | Every tracker         |
| Exact   | `tracker.example.com` | Only that domain      |
| Glob    | `*.example.com`       | Subdomains            |
| Suffix  | `.example.com`        | Domain and subdomains |

Separate multiple patterns with commas, semicolons, or pipes. All matching is case-insensitive.

## Grouping

Grouping lets an automation treat "related torrents" as a single unit for:

- **Group-aware conditions**: `GROUP_SIZE`, `IS_GROUPED`
- **Group expansion**: apply an action to every torrent in the group (instead of only the matched torrent)
- **Strict matching**: grouped expansion runs only when all members satisfy the action conditions

### Group-Scoped Condition Fields

`GROUP_SIZE` and `IS_GROUPED` can be scoped per condition row:

- Set `groupId` on each `GROUP_SIZE` / `IS_GROUPED` condition if you want explicit per-row grouping.
- If a grouped condition row has no `groupId`, qui uses `conditions.grouping.defaultGroupId`.
- If no default is configured, legacy unscoped grouped conditions fall back to `cross_seed_content_save_path`.

This allows multiple grouped conditions in the same workflow, each using different grouping strategies.

### Action Expansion

Some actions accept a `groupId`. When set, qui expands the action to all torrents in that group.

Group expansion semantics are strict:

- Every member in the expanded group must satisfy the action condition checks for that rule.
- If any member fails (or the group cannot be resolved), qui skips the entire grouped action.
- There is no "trigger-only fallback" when `groupId` is set.

Built-in group IDs:

- `cross_seed_content_path`: same Content Path (normalized)
- `cross_seed_content_save_path`: same Content Path + Save Path (normalized)
- `release_item`: same Content Type + Effective Name
- `tracker_release_item`: same Tracker + Content Type + Effective Name
- `hardlink_signature`: same physical file set signature (requires local filesystem access)

### Custom Groups (Advanced)

Rules can define custom groups via `conditions.grouping.groups[]` with:

- `id`: string
- `keys`: list of key names combined to form the group key

Supported keys:

- `contentPath`, `savePath`, `effectiveName`, `contentType`, `tracker`
- `rlsSource`, `rlsResolution`, `rlsCodec`, `rlsHDR`, `rlsAudio`, `rlsChannels`, `rlsGroup`
- `hardlinkSignature`

For content-path-based grouping where `Content Path == Save Path` (ambiguous), you can set:

- `ambiguousPolicy: "verify_overlap"` (default for cross-seed groups) with `minFileOverlapPercent` (default `90`)
- `ambiguousPolicy: "skip"`

## Actions

Actions can be combined (except Delete which must be standalone). Each action supports an optional condition override.

### Speed Limits

Set upload and/or download limits. Each field supports these modes:

| Mode      | Value | Description                                            |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| No change | -     | Don't modify this field                                |
| Unlimited | 0     | Remove speed limit (qBittorrent treats 0 as unlimited) |
| Custom    | >0    | Specific limit in KiB/s or MiB/s                       |

Applied in batches for efficiency.

### Share Limits

Set ratio limit and/or seeding time limit. Each field supports these modes:

| Mode       | Value | Description                                        |
| ---------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| No change  | -     | Don't modify this field                            |
| Use global | -2    | Follow qBittorrent's global share settings         |
| Unlimited  | -1    | No limit for this field                            |
| Custom     | >=0   | Specific value (ratio as decimal, time in minutes) |

Torrents stop seeding when any enabled limit is reached.

### Pause

Pause matching torrents. Only pauses if not already stopped.

If a resume action is also present, last action wins.

### Resume

Resume matching torrents. Only resumes if not already running.

If a pause action is also present, last action wins.

### Force Recheck

Force recheck matching torrents.

- Triggers qBittorrent recheck for matched torrents.
- Can be combined with other actions.
- Supports optional condition override (like other actions).

### Force Reannounce

Force reannounce matching torrents.

- Triggers immediate tracker reannounce for matched torrents.
- Can be combined with other actions.
- Supports optional condition override (like other actions).

### Delete

Remove torrents from qBittorrent. **Must be standalone** - cannot combine with other actions.

| Mode                                | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `delete`                            | Remove from client, keep files                                                |
| `deleteWithFiles`                   | Remove with files                                                             |
| `deleteWithFilesPreserveCrossSeeds` | Remove files but preserve if cross-seeds detected                             |
| `deleteWithFilesIncludeCrossSeeds`  | Remove files and also delete all cross-seeded torrents sharing the same files |

**Optional grouping (advanced):**

Delete actions can specify a `groupId` to expand the deletion to all torrents in that group.

- For `delete` (keep files): this is useful when you want "remove from client" to be cross-seed aware.
- With `groupId`, keep-files delete is strict all-or-none: if any group member does not satisfy rule conditions, nothing in that group is removed.

**Include cross-seeds mode behavior:**

When a torrent matches the rule, the system finds other torrents that point to the same downloaded files (cross-seeds/duplicates) and deletes them together. This is useful when you want to fully remove content and all its cross-seeded copies at once.

- **Safe expansion**: If qui can't safely confirm another torrent uses the same files, it won't be included in the deletion.
- **Safety-first**: If verification can't complete for any reason, the entire group is skipped rather than risking broken torrents.
- **Preview**: The delete preview shows all torrents that would be deleted, with cross-seeds marked.

**Include hardlinked copies:**

When "Include hardlinked copies" is enabled (only available with `deleteWithFilesIncludeCrossSeeds` mode), the system also deletes torrents that share the same underlying physical files via hardlinks, even if they have different Content Paths.

- **Requires**: Local Filesystem Access must be enabled on the instance.
- **Safe scope**: Only includes hardlinks that are fully contained within qBittorrent's torrent set. Never follows hardlinks to files outside qBittorrent (e.g., your media library).
- **Preview**: Hardlink-expanded torrents are marked as "Cross-seed (hardlinked)" in the preview.
- **Free Space projection**: When combined with Free Space conditions, hardlink groups are correctly deduplicated in the space projection - torrents sharing the same physical files are only counted once.

This is useful when you have hardlinked copies of content across different locations in qBittorrent and want to clean up all copies together.

### Tag

Manage tags on torrents. You can add multiple Tag actions in one workflow.

| Mode     | Description                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `full`   | Add to matches, remove from non-matches (smart toggle) |
| `add`    | Only add to matches                                    |
| `remove` | Only remove from matches                               |

:::note
`mode: remove` removes tags from torrents that match the tag action condition. It does not remove from non-matches.
:::

`mode: full` is evaluated within the rule's scope for that run (enabled rule, tracker pattern match, and run eligibility). It is not a client-wide sweep by itself.

Options:

- **Managed / Replace in Client** - `Managed` (default) applies per-torrent add/remove diffs only. `Replace in client` deletes managed tags from qBittorrent first, then reapplies to current matches.
- **Use Tracker as Tag** - Derive tag from tracker domain
- **Use Display Name** - Use tracker customization display name instead of raw domain

Behavior reference:

| Configuration                  | Behavior |
| ----------------------------- | -------- |
| `mode: full` + `Managed`      | Adds/removes tag for torrents this rule evaluates. No client-wide reset. |
| `mode: full` + `Replace in client` | Deletes selected tag(s) client-wide first, then re-adds only current matches. |

If you see repeated activity like `+tag=696` every run, that usually means **Replace in client** is enabled for that tag action.

Quick troubleshooting:

1. Check logs for `automations: deleted managed tags from client before retagging`.
2. In Automations UI, open enabled rules and verify whether "Replace in client" is enabled on any tag action.
3. Confirm the activity entry's rule list matches the rule you expect.

### Category

Move torrents to a different category.

Options:

- **Include Cross-Seeds** - Also move cross-seeds (matching ContentPath AND SavePath)
- **Group ID (advanced)** - Expand category changes to all torrents in the specified group (see [Grouping](#grouping)). If set, this takes precedence over "Include Cross-Seeds".
- **Strict grouped matching** - With `groupId`, category expansion applies only when all group members satisfy the category rule checks.
- **Block If Cross-Seed In Categories** - Prevent move if another cross-seed is in protected categories

### Move

Move torrents to a different path on disk. This is needed to move the contents if AutoTMM is not enabled.

Options:
- **Group ID (advanced)** - Expand moves to all torrents in the specified group (see [Grouping](#grouping)). The move path is resolved for the matched torrent and then applied to the whole group.
- **Strict grouped matching** - With `groupId`, move expansion is all-or-none: every member must satisfy the move rule checks.
- **Skip if cross-seeds don't match the rule's conditions** - Skip the move if the torrent has cross-seeds that don't match the rule's conditions. This is ignored when **Group ID** is set.

#### Move path templates

The move path is evaluated as a **Go template** for each torrent. You can use a fixed path (e.g. `/data/archive`) or template actions to build paths from torrent properties.

**Available template variables:**

| Variable               | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.Name`                | Torrent display name                                                                     |
| `.Hash`                | Info hash                                                                                |
| `.Category`            | qBittorrent category                                                                     |
| `.IsolationFolderName` | Filesystem-safe folder name (hash or sanitized name)                                     |
| `.Tracker`             | Tracker display name (when available from instance config), otherwise the tracker domain |

**Template function:**

| Function   | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sanitize` | Makes a string safe for use as a path segment (removes invalid characters). Use for user-controlled values like names, e.g. `{{ sanitize .Name }}`. |

**Examples:**

- Fixed path (no template actions): `/data/archive`
- By category: `/data/{{.Category}}` → e.g. `/data/movies`
- By name (safe for paths): `/data/{{ sanitize .Name }}`
- By isolation folder: `/data/{{.IsolationFolderName}}`
- By tracker: `/data/{{.Tracker}}` (when tracker display name is configured)

### Auto Management

Enable or disable qBittorrent's Automatic Torrent Management (AutoTMM) on matching torrents.

| Mode      | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `enable`  | Enable automatic torrent management on matches   |
| `disable` | Disable automatic torrent management on matches  |

When AutoTMM is enabled, qBittorrent automatically moves torrents to the save path configured for their category. Disabling it allows manual control of save paths.

If multiple rules match the same torrent with Auto Management actions, the **last matching rule** (by sort order) wins.

### External Program

Run a pre-configured external program when torrents match the automation rule. Uses the same programs configured in **Settings → External Programs**.

| Field                  | Description                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Program**            | Select from enabled external programs      |
| **Condition Override** | Optional condition specific to this action |

**Behavior:**

- Executes asynchronously (fire-and-forget) to avoid blocking automation processing
- Can be combined with other actions (speed limits, share limits, pause, tag, category)
- Only enabled programs appear in the dropdown
- Activity is logged with rule name, torrent details, and success/failure status

:::note
The program must be enabled in Settings → External Programs to appear in the automation dropdown.
:::

:::note
When multiple rules match the same torrent with External Program actions enabled, the **last matching rule** (by sort order) determines which program executes for that torrent. Only one program runs per torrent per automation cycle.
:::

:::warning
The program's executable path must be present in the application's allowlist. Programs that are disabled or have forbidden paths will not run—attempts are rejected and logged in the activity log with the rule name and torrent details.
:::

**Use cases:**

- Run post-processing scripts when torrents complete
- Notify external systems (webhooks, notifications) when conditions are met
- Trigger media library scans after category changes
- Execute cleanup scripts for old or stalled torrents

## Cross-Seed Awareness

Automations detect cross-seeded torrents (same content/files) and can handle them specially:

- **Detection** - Cross-seed condition fields use the same matching logic as **Filter Cross-Seeds**: content path, exact name, and release metadata. Same-instance checks exclude the current torrent itself.
- **Delete Rules**:
  - Use `deleteWithFilesPreserveCrossSeeds` to keep files if cross-seeds exist
  - Use `deleteWithFilesIncludeCrossSeeds` to delete matching torrents and all their cross-seeds together
- **Category Rules** - Enable "Include Cross-Seeds" to move related torrents together
- **Blocking** - Prevent category moves if cross-seeds are in protected categories

### Hardlink Detection

The `HARDLINK_SCOPE` field lets automations distinguish between torrents whose files are hardlinked into an external library (Sonarr, Radarr, etc.) and torrents that exist only within qBittorrent. This is the foundation for safe "Remove Upgraded Torrents" automations.

#### How scope is determined

When an automation references `HARDLINK_SCOPE`, qui builds a hardlink index by calling `Lstat()` on every file of every torrent in qBittorrent. For each file it extracts:

- The **inode** and **device ID** — uniquely identifying the file on disk.
- The **nlink count** — the total number of hardlinks to that inode, as reported by the filesystem.

It then counts how many unique file paths across the entire qBittorrent torrent set point to each inode. The scope for each torrent is determined by comparing these two numbers:

| Scope                 | Condition                                                                    | Meaning                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`                | No file has `nlink > 1`                                                      | No hardlinks detected.                                                                            |
| `torrents_only`       | At least one file has `nlink > 1`, and no file has `nlink > uniquePathCount` | Hardlinks exist, but only between torrents in qBittorrent. No external library links.             |
| `outside_qbittorrent` | Any file has `nlink > uniquePathCount`                                       | Something outside qBittorrent has hardlinked the file — typically a Sonarr/Radarr library import. |

:::note
`HARDLINK_SCOPE` only reflects hardlink metadata. Cross-seeds are detected separately (ContentPath matching), so a torrent can have `HARDLINK_SCOPE = none` and still be cross-seeded.
:::

#### Unknown scope and safety behavior

If qui cannot `Lstat()` **any** file in a torrent — due to wrong paths, missing permissions, or inaccessible storage — that torrent receives no scope entry. All `HARDLINK_SCOPE` conditions evaluate to `false` for that torrent, regardless of the operator or value. This is a safety measure to prevent unintended deletions of torrents qui cannot fully inspect.

To diagnose this, enable debug logging and look for the "hardlink index built" log message, which reports an `inaccessible` count.

#### Docker volume requirements

For hardlink scope detection to work in Docker:

1. **Paths must match exactly.** qui must be able to read files at the same paths qBittorrent reports. If qBittorrent says a torrent's save path is `/data/torrents/radarr/`, qui must be able to access `/data/torrents/radarr/` inside its container.

2. **Same underlying storage.** Both containers must share the same host mount so that inode numbers are consistent. If qui and qBittorrent access the same files through different host mounts or different bind-mount configurations, inode numbers may not match.

3. **Single mount, not subdivided.** Mount the common parent directory rather than mounting subdirectories separately. For example, if your data lives under `/mnt/media/data` on the host:

```yaml
services:
  qui:
    volumes:
      - /home/user/docker/qui:/config
      - /mnt/media/data:/data # single mount covering both torrents and library
```

Avoid mounting both `/mnt/media/data/torrents:/data/torrents` **and** `/mnt/media/data:/data` — the overlapping mounts can cause inconsistent inode visibility. Use a single mount at the common parent.

#### Filesystem limitations

Hardlink scope detection depends on the kernel reporting accurate `nlink` values in stat results. Some filesystems do not do this:

- **FUSE-based filesystems** (sshfs, mergerfs, rclone mount) may report `nlink = 1` for all files regardless of actual hardlink count.
- **Some NAS appliance filesystems** and **overlay filesystems** (overlayfs) may behave similarly.
- **Network filesystems** (NFS, CIFS/SMB) generally report accurate nlink values but behavior varies by server implementation.

On affected filesystems, every torrent appears to have scope `none` because nlink is always 1. There is no workaround within qui — this is a kernel/filesystem limitation. If you suspect this issue, run `stat` on a file you know is hardlinked and check the "Links" count.

Hardlinks also cannot span across different filesystems. If your torrent data and media library are on separate filesystems (or separate Docker volumes backed by different host paths), Sonarr/Radarr will copy instead of hardlink, and scope detection has nothing to detect.

#### Example: Remove Upgraded Torrents

This automation deletes torrents that have been replaced by an upgrade in Sonarr/Radarr. It targets torrents where the library hardlink no longer exists (the arr removed or re-linked it during upgrade), the torrent has been seeding for at least 7 days, and the category matches your arr categories.

:::tip
Use `HARDLINK_SCOPE` with `NOT_EQUAL` to `outside_qbittorrent` rather than `EQUAL` to `none`. This way torrents with scope `torrents_only` (cross-seeded but not in a library) are also eligible for cleanup, while any torrent still linked into your media library is protected.
:::

```json
{
  "name": "Remove Upgraded Torrents",
  "trackerPattern": "*",
  "trackerDomains": ["*"],
  "conditions": {
    "schemaVersion": "1",
    "delete": {
      "enabled": true,
      "mode": "deleteWithFilesPreserveCrossSeeds",
      "condition": {
        "operator": "AND",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": "OR",
            "conditions": [
              { "field": "CATEGORY", "operator": "EQUAL", "value": "radarr" },
              {
                "field": "CATEGORY",
                "operator": "EQUAL",
                "value": "radarr.cross"
              },
              {
                "field": "CATEGORY",
                "operator": "EQUAL",
                "value": "tv-sonarr"
              },
              {
                "field": "CATEGORY",
                "operator": "EQUAL",
                "value": "tv-sonarr.cross"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "field": "HARDLINK_SCOPE",
            "operator": "NOT_EQUAL",
            "value": "outside_qbittorrent"
          },
          {
            "field": "SEEDING_TIME",
            "operator": "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL",
            "value": "604800"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This works because when Sonarr/Radarr upgrades a release, the old library hardlink is removed. The old torrent's files then have `nlink == 1` (scope `none`) or are only linked to other torrents (scope `torrents_only`). Either way, the scope is not `outside_qbittorrent`, so the automation matches and deletes the torrent after the seeding time requirement is met.

If the automation is matching torrents you expect to be protected, verify:

1. qui can access all torrent files at the paths qBittorrent reports (check debug logs for inaccessible files).
2. Your filesystem reports accurate nlink values (`stat <file>` should show Links > 1 for hardlinked files).
3. Your Docker volume mounts do not overlap or subdivide the storage in a way that breaks inode consistency.

### Cross-Instance Hardlink Detection

The `HARDLINK_SCOPE_CROSS` field extends hardlink detection across **all** configured qBittorrent instances. While `HARDLINK_SCOPE` only considers torrents within a single instance, `HARDLINK_SCOPE_CROSS` accounts for hardlinks to files managed by any instance with local filesystem access enabled.

This is essential for multi-instance setups where cross-seeds are hardlinked across instances. Without cross-instance awareness, those hardlinks appear as `outside_qbittorrent` even though they point to files managed by another qBittorrent instance.

#### Scope values

| Scope                 | Meaning                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `none`                | No hardlinks detected.                                                   |
| `torrents_only`       | All hardlinks are accounted for across all qBittorrent instances.        |
| `outside_qbittorrent` | Hardlinks exist to files outside all qBittorrent instances.              |

#### Combining with HARDLINK_SCOPE

Use both fields together to distinguish cross-instance hardlinks from truly external links:

| Combination | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| `HARDLINK_SCOPE = outside_qbittorrent` AND `HARDLINK_SCOPE_CROSS = torrents_only` | Hardlinks point to other qBittorrent instances only (cross-seeds). No media library copy. |
| `HARDLINK_SCOPE = outside_qbittorrent` AND `HARDLINK_SCOPE_CROSS = outside_qbittorrent` | Hardlinks point outside all instances — typically a media library import. |
| `HARDLINK_SCOPE = torrents_only` | All hardlinks within this instance. `HARDLINK_SCOPE_CROSS` will also be `torrents_only`. |

#### Prerequisites

`HARDLINK_SCOPE_CROSS` requires:

1. **Local Filesystem Access** enabled on **all** instances whose files you want considered. Instances without it are skipped — their files won't be scanned, and unresolved hardlinks will conservatively show as `outside_qbittorrent`.
2. **Same filesystem** across all instances. Hardlinks cannot cross filesystem boundaries.
3. **Matching paths in Docker** — same volume mount requirements as `HARDLINK_SCOPE`, applied to every instance.

#### Performance

Cross-instance scanning only runs when:
- A rule uses `HARDLINK_SCOPE_CROSS`
- The single-instance scan found torrents with unresolved outside links

When triggered, it uses cached torrent and file data from other instances (no extra API calls) and only calls `Lstat()` on files that might resolve the unaccounted hardlinks. Scanning stops as soon as all deficits are resolved.

A safety budget of 500,000 `Lstat()` calls limits the cross-instance scan. If the budget is exhausted before all deficits are resolved, the remaining torrents conservatively report `outside_qbittorrent`. This prevents excessive filesystem operations in large multi-instance setups. A warning is logged if the budget is reached.

#### Example: noHL tagging in multi-instance setups

This rule tags torrents with `noHL` when they have no media library hardlinks, even if they have cross-instance hardlinks to other qBittorrent instances:

```json
{
  "name": "Tag noHL (multi-instance)",
  "trackerPattern": "*",
  "trackerDomains": ["*"],
  "conditions": {
    "schemaVersion": "1",
    "tags": [
      {
        "enabled": true,
        "mode": "add",
        "tags": ["noHL"],
        "condition": {
          "operator": "AND",
          "conditions": [
            {
              "field": "HARDLINK_SCOPE_CROSS",
              "operator": "NOT_EQUAL",
              "value": "outside_qbittorrent"
            },
            {
              "field": "STATE",
              "operator": "EQUAL",
              "value": "uploading"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This works because `HARDLINK_SCOPE_CROSS != outside_qbittorrent` matches both `none` (no hardlinks) and `torrents_only` (hardlinks only between qBittorrent instances). Torrents with a media library copy (`outside_qbittorrent`) are excluded from the tag.

## Missing Files Detection

The `Has Missing Files` field detects whether any files belonging to a completed torrent are missing from disk.

- Only checks **completed torrents**
- Returns `true` if **any** file is missing from its expected path

:::note
Requires "Local filesystem access" enabled on the instance.
:::

## Important Behavior

### Settings Only Set Values

Automations apply settings but **do not revert** when disabled or deleted. If a rule sets upload limit to 1000 KiB/s, affected torrents keep that limit until manually changed or another rule applies a different value.

### Efficient Updates

Only sends API calls when the torrent's current setting differs from the desired value. No-op updates are skipped.

### Processing Order

- **First match wins** for delete actions (delete ends torrent processing, no further rules evaluated)
- **Last rule wins** for speed limits, share limits, category, and external program actions
- **Accumulative** for tag actions (tags are combined across matching rules)

### Free Space Condition Behavior

When using the **Free Space** condition in delete rules, the system uses intelligent cumulative tracking:

1. **Configurable processing order** - Torrents are processed according to the automation's Torrent Priority (Default, Simple, or Score). This allows you to prioritize cleanups (e.g., largest files first, or lowest score first).
2. **Cumulative space tracking** - As each torrent is marked for deletion, its size is added to the projected free space (only when the delete mode actually frees disk bytes).
3. **Stop when satisfied** - Once `Free Space + Space To Be Cleared` exceeds your threshold, remaining torrents no longer match.
4. **Cross-seed aware** - Cross-seeded torrents sharing the same files are only counted once to avoid overestimating freed space

**Preview Views for Free Space Rules**

When previewing a delete rule with a Free Space condition, a toggle allows switching between two views:

| View                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Needed to reach target** | Shows only the torrents that would be removed right now to reach your free-space target. This is the default view and reflects actual delete behavior.                                                            |
| **All eligible**           | Shows all torrents this rule could remove while free space is low. Useful for understanding the full scope of what the rule could potentially delete (may include cross-seeds that don't directly match filters). |

The toggle only appears for delete rules that use the Free Space condition.

**Preview features:**

- **Path column** - Shows the content path for each torrent with copy-to-clipboard support
- **Export CSV** - Download the full preview list (all pages) as a CSV file for external analysis

**Cross-seed expansion in previews:**

Cross-seeds are only expanded and displayed in the preview when using `Remove with files (include cross-seeds)` mode. In this mode, the preview shows all torrents that would be deleted together, with cross-seeds clearly marked. Other delete modes don't expand cross-seeds in the preview since they either preserve cross-seeds or don't consider them specially.

**Delete mode affects space projection:**

| Delete Mode                            | Space Added to Projection |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Remove with files                      | Full torrent size         |
| Preserve cross-seeds (no cross-seeds)  | Full torrent size         |
| Preserve cross-seeds (has cross-seeds) | 0 (files kept)            |

**How preserve cross-seeds works:**

- Cross-seed detection checks if any other torrent shares the same Content Path at evaluation time (before any removals).
- If multiple torrents share the same files, removing them all in one rule run will still keep the files on disk. No disk space is freed from that group because each torrent sees the others as cross-seeds.
- Only non-cross-seeded torrents contribute to the free-space projection when using preserve mode.

**Example:** With 400GB free and a rule "Delete if Free Space < 500GB" using `Remove with files`, the system deletes oldest torrents until the cumulative freed space reaches 100GB, then stops. A 50GB torrent and its cross-seed (same files) only count as 50GB freed, not 100GB.

:::note
The UI and API prevent combining `Remove (keep files)` mode with Free Space conditions. Since keep-files doesn't free disk space, such a rule could never satisfy the free space target and would match indefinitely.
:::

:::note
After removing files, qui waits ~5 minutes before running Free Space deletes again to allow qBittorrent to refresh its disk free space reading. The UI prevents selecting 1 minute intervals for Free Space delete rules.

#### Free Space Source

By default, Free Space uses qBittorrent's reported free space (based on its default download location). If you have multiple disks or want to manage a specific mount point, select "Path on server" and enter the path to that disk.

| Source                | Description                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Default (qBittorrent) | Uses qBittorrent's reported free space           |
| Path on server        | Reads free space from a specific filesystem path |

:::note
Path on server requires "Local Filesystem Access" to be enabled on the instance.
:::

If you want to manage multiple disks, create one workflow per disk and set a different Path on server for each workflow.

:::note
On Windows, Path on server is not supported and Free Space always uses qBittorrent's reported free space. The UI disables the option and switches legacy workflows back to the default when opened.
:::

### Batching

Torrents are grouped by action value and sent to qBittorrent in batches of up to 50 hashes per API call.

## Activity Log

All automation actions are logged with:

- Torrent name and hash
- Rule name and action type
- Outcome (success/failed) with reasons
- Action-specific details

Activity is retained for 7 days by default. View the log in the Automations section for each instance.

## Example Rules

### Delete Old Completed Torrents

Remove torrents completed over 30 days ago when disk space is low:

- Condition: `Completion On Age > 30 days` AND `State is completed` AND `Free Space < 500GB`
- Action: Remove with files

Deletes matching torrents in the configured priority order (e.g., oldest first), stopping once enough space would be freed to exceed 500GB.

### Speed Limit Private Trackers

Limit upload on private trackers:

- Tracker: `*`
- Condition: `Private is true`
- Action: Upload limit 10000 KiB/s

### Tag Stalled Torrents

Auto-tag torrents with no activity:

- Tracker: `*`
- Condition: `Last Activity Age > 7 days`
- Action: Tag "stalled" (mode: add)

### Clean Unregistered Torrents

Remove torrents the tracker no longer recognizes:

- Tracker: `*`
- Condition: `Is Unregistered is true`
- Action: Delete (keep files)

### Maintain Minimum Free Space

Keep at least 200GB free by removing oldest completed torrents:

- Tracker: `*`
- Condition: `Free Space < 200GB` AND `State is completed`
- Action: Remove with files (preserve cross-seeds)

Removes torrents from the client in the configured priority order, until enough space is projected to be freed. Cross-seeded torrents keep their files on disk and don't contribute to the projection. If only cross-seeded torrents match, this may remove many torrents without freeing any disk space.

### Clean Up Old Content with Cross-Seeds

Remove completed torrents and all their cross-seeded copies when they're old enough:

- Tracker: `*`
- Condition: `Completion On Age > 30 days` AND `State is completed`
- Action: Remove with files (include cross-seeds)

When a torrent matches, any other torrents pointing to the same downloaded files are deleted together. Useful for complete cleanup when you no longer need any copy of the content.

### Organize by Tracker

Move torrents to tracker-named categories:

- Tracker: `tracker.example.com`
- Action: Category "example" with "Include Cross-Seeds" enabled

### Post-Processing on Completion

Run a script when torrents finish downloading:

- Tracker: `*`
- Condition: `State is completed` AND `Progress = 100`
- Action: External Program "post-process.sh"

### Notify on Stalled Torrents

Alert an external monitoring system when torrents stall:

- Tracker: `*`
- Condition: `State is stalled` AND `Last Activity Age > 24 hours`
- Action: External Program "send-alert" + Tag "stalled" (mode: add)
