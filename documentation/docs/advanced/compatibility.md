# qBittorrent Version Compatibility

:::note
qui officially supports qBittorrent 4.3.9 and newer as the baseline. The features below may require newer builds as noted, and anything older than 4.3.9 might still connect, but functionality is not guaranteed.
:::

qui automatically detects the features available on each qBittorrent instance and adjusts the interface accordingly. Certain features require newer qBittorrent versions and will be disabled when connecting to older instances:

| Feature | Minimum Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rename Torrent** | 4.1.0+ (Web API 2.0.0+) | Change the display name of torrents |
| **Tracker Editing** | 4.1.5+ (Web API 2.2.0+) | Edit, add, and remove tracker URLs |
| **File Priority Controls** | 4.1.5+ (Web API 2.2.0+) | Enable/disable files and adjust download priority levels |
| **Rename File** | 4.2.1+ (Web API 2.4.0+) | Rename individual files within torrents |
| **Rename Folder** | 4.3.3+ (Web API 2.7.0+) | Rename folders within torrents |
| **Per-Torrent Temporary Download Path** | 4.4.0+ (Web API 2.8.4+) | A custom temporary download path may be set when adding torrents |
| **Torrent Export (.torrent download)** | 4.5.0+ (Web API 2.8.11+) | Download .torrent files via `/api/v2/torrents/export`; first appeared in 4.5.0beta1 |
| **Backups (.torrent archive export)** | 4.5.0+ (Web API 2.8.11+) | qui backups rely on `/torrents/export`; the backup UI is hidden when the endpoint is unavailable |
| **Subcategories** | 4.6.0+ (Web API 2.9.0+) | Support for nested category structures (e.g., `Movies/Action`) |
| **Torrent Creation** | 5.0.0+ (Web API 2.11.2+) | Create new .torrent files via the Web API |
| **Path Autocomplete** | 5.0.0+ (Web API 2.11.2+) | Autocomplete suggestions for path inputs when adding torrents or creating .torrent files |
| **External IP Reporting (IPv4/IPv6)** | 5.1.0+ (Web API 2.11.3+) | Exposes `last_external_address_v4` / `_v6` fields |
| **Tracker Health Status** | 5.1.0+ (Web API 2.11.4+) | Automatically detects unregistered torrents and tracker issues |
| **Share limit action** | 5.2.0+ (Web API **2.15.1**+) | Per-torrent behavior when ratio, seeding time, or inactive seeding limits are hit (stop, remove, remove with content, enable super seeding). qui exposes this when the instance reports Web API **2.15.1** or newer. |
| **Share limit mode** | unreleased (Web API **2.16.0**+) | Whether that action runs when **any** configured limit is reached or only when **all** are. Shown only when the instance reports Web API **2.16.0** or newer (newer than action-only support). |

:::note
Hybrid and v2 torrent creation requires a qBittorrent build that links against libtorrent v2. Builds compiled with libtorrent 1.x ignore the `format` parameter.

## Authentication Compatibility

### API key auth with reverse-proxy Basic Auth

qBittorrent API key authentication uses the HTTP `Authorization: Bearer ...` header. Reverse-proxy Basic Auth, such as nginx `auth_basic`, also uses the `Authorization` header.

Because a request can only carry one normal `Authorization` value, qBittorrent API key authentication cannot be combined with reverse-proxy Basic Auth in the default setup. Use qBittorrent username/password authentication with reverse-proxy Basic Auth, or bypass Basic Auth for qui's requests to qBittorrent.

## Troubleshooting: Missing Features

### Create Torrent button is not visible

The **Create Torrent** button in the header bar is only displayed when qui detects that your qBittorrent instance supports the torrent creation API. If you do not see the button, your qBittorrent version is below **5.0.0** (Web API v2.11.2).

To resolve this, upgrade qBittorrent to version 5.0.0 or later and refresh the qui web UI.

### Hybrid and v2 torrent formats are unavailable

Even with qBittorrent 5.0.0+, the **hybrid** and **v2** torrent format options require qBittorrent to be built against **libtorrent v2.x**. If your build uses libtorrent 1.x, the torrent creation dialog will display an alert indicating that only the **v1** format is available. This is a build-time dependency of qBittorrent itself and cannot be changed through qui.

### "Too many active torrent creation tasks" error

There is a limit on the number of concurrent torrent creation tasks. If you see a **409 Conflict** error with this message, wait for your existing creation tasks to finish before starting new ones. You can monitor active tasks in the torrent creation task list.
