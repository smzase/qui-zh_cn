## Testing

- `make test` runs the Go suite with `-race -count=1`.
- `make test-frontend` runs the vitest suite in `web/`. Tests are colocated as `*.test.ts(x)` under `web/src/`.
- For iterative local work: `cd web && pnpm test:watch`.
- For a coverage report: `cd web && pnpm test:coverage`.
- CI runs both `make test` and `make test-frontend` on every PR.
- Frontend changes should ship with vitest specs. Behavior jsdom can't render — virtualization, drag-and-drop, scroll — needs a manual smoke (a passing suite isn't full coverage).

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`web/AGENTS.md`](web/AGENTS.md) for agent-specific conventions.

## Database Migrations

Database schema changes must include:

- a SQLite migration under `internal/database/migrations`
- a Postgres migration under `internal/database/postgres_migrations`
- matching model/store updates in the same PR so schema and code stay in sync

For an open PR, keep schema work consolidated to at most one new migration file per driver:

- one file under `internal/database/migrations`
- one file under `internal/database/postgres_migrations`

If a PR needs more schema changes before merge, update the draft migration files for that PR instead of adding more migration files. Consolidate before merge.

Do not land schema-only changes. The corresponding model/store files touched by the schema change must be updated in the same PR.
